# Libgdx-Flappy-Bird
This personal project was inspired by a forum post, "How long does it take to develop a game like Flappy Bird"?. The general answer was that the game should take about 1 day to code,excluding the artworks and stuff.

In the post, people tried to code the game using different languages/frameworks such as HTML5 and cocos2d.

I just learned Libgdx last quarter from our group project in ECS 160: Software Engineering class, and I wanted test my skill and see how long it would take me to code the game.

The images I used for the game were from

Conclusion: I finished the game in 1 day! Proud of myself!

To play the game, download the project and open it with Android Studio. 
Then, build the project and run the built apk in an emulator or a real android device.

It's also possible to play the game in desktop by:
Right clicking DesktopLauncher in Android Studio, and then click "Run 'DesktopLauncher ... main()' "
If the game doesn't open, set the working directory of the application to android\assets and to run the game again.
