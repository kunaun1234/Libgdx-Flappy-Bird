# Libgdx-Flappy-Bird
This personal project was inspired by a forum post, "How long does it take to develop a game like Flappy Bird"?.

The general answer was that the game should take about 1 day to code,excluding the artworks and stuff.

In the post, people tried to code the game using different languages/frameworks such as HTML5 and cocos2d.

I just learned Libgdx last quarter from my group project my Software Engineering, and I wanted test my skill and see how long it would take me to code the game.

The images I used for the game were from

Conclusion: I finished the game in 1 day! Proud of myself!!
